# A Call to Preserve Our Digital Legacy

In the fast-paced world of technology, we often forget that the code we write, the projects we build, and the communities we foster are more than just lines on a screen. They are our digital legacy, the foundation upon which countless innovations are built, and the lifeline for many companies and individuals who rely on these open-source contributions.

The recent disappearance of the Stark & Wayne GitHub organization serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of our digital ecosystems. With 90 open-source projects suddenly vanishing, we're not just losing code – we're losing years of collective effort, knowledge, and potential.

To those who manage GitHub organizations or any digital platforms: Please remember that your decisions ripple far beyond your immediate sphere. When you consider removing an organization or a repository, you're not just deleting files; you're potentially disrupting businesses, derailing projects, and disheartening contributors who have invested their time and expertise.

The dangers of this practice are manifold:

1. **Loss of Trust**: It erodes the trust that the open-source community is built upon. Contributors may hesitate to invest their time in projects that could vanish without warning.

2. **Disrupted Dependencies**: Many projects and businesses rely on these open-source tools. Removing them without notice can break critical systems and workflows.

3. **Knowledge Gap**: Documentation, issues, and discussions in these repositories often contain valuable insights and solutions. Their loss creates a knowledge gap that's hard to fill.

4. **Discouraged Innovation**: The fear of losing work may discourage developers from creating and sharing innovative solutions.

5. **Community Fragmentation**: Sudden removals can scatter communities that have formed around these projects, making it difficult to regroup and continue collaboration.

We urge all maintainers and organizations to consider the far-reaching impact of their actions. If you must remove a repository or an entire organization, please:

- Provide ample notice to the community
- Offer clear explanations for your decision
- Ensure proper archiving of the code and related resources
- Guide users and contributors on migration paths or alternatives

Let's commit to preserving our digital heritage, fostering a stable environment for innovation, and upholding the collaborative spirit that makes open source so powerful. Together, we can ensure that the foundations we lay today will continue to support the technologies of tomorrow.

Remember, in the world of open source, we're not just writing code – we're building our legacy.
